    <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Let's talk about AI safety especially that I come from a Cybersecurity background.</span></h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Every new innovation comes with its problems and safety concerns. In order to implement counter measures we need to see the effect and the safety concerns that comes out of it in other words the innovation in this case AI needs to be used and adopted just like we have adopted the internet, like that we will have a clearer vision on how to approach security measures and implement them.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">It isn't clear on how we are going to approach AI safety just yet, I think that is because we are yet to see it's operational effectiveness on the internet,one of the methods Anti-virus products improve is by analyzing more malware samples for example, Same concept applies to AI, it's safety is directly proportional to it's usage. So before we start evaluating safety measures its important to understand the magnitude of what we are dealing with.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Now I wanted to test if I could potentially generate fake credit cards using, at first ChatGPT was stubborn and didn't want to give me them fake credit card details, but at the end I was able to Jailbreak it and getting it to generate fake credit card info, in other words I bypassed them safety and moderation features.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">So to give you an idea on how ChatGPT responds when asking it for fake credit cards this is how it responds,</span></p>
