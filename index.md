Hello,
My name is Hussein Muhaisen.

Found interest in everything computers at the age of 7 as I had a computer and some Atari video game console, love computer security, consumer tech, and everything that intersects. Interested in design too. I have a mission that needs to be accomplished.

Grew up moving from country to country which helped expose different cultures = different adaptations.

If I am not facing problems I am failing at something.

I started hacking early on, always was interested in everything really that gets me hooked, played lots of video games made some cool achievements, was the photoshop guy in school in 8th grade, started managing creators around that time too, built, scaled, sold online communities. Did get suspended from school multiple times, used to ditch school to learn hacking.

I believe in integrity, nobility, and honesty.
