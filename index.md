Hello World,

Found interest in everything computers at the age of 7 as I had a computer and an Atari video game console, love computer security, and everything that intersects. If I am not facing problems I am failing at something.

I started hacking into computers early on, played lots of video games made some cool achievements. I believe in integrity, nobility, and honesty.

Some quotes I wrote: “A vision is feasible for the visionary and impractical for the vision less”  “Do great work! and always question the current thing” “Give to be given”.
